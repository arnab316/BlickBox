# Movie Streaming App

This is a movie streaming app built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Redux** on the front-end. The application allows users to browse trending and top-rated movies, view movie details, and handle user authentication with a modal-based login and signup flow. The app is designed to be API-driven, with movie data being fetched dynamically in the future.

## Demo

Coming soon! This will showcase the functionality of the app.

## Features

- **Home Page**: Displays a featured movie along with categories like "Trending" and "Top Rated."
- **Movie Details**: Users can click on any movie to view its details on a separate page.
- **Authentication**: Modal-based login and signup functionality using a Redux state to manage authentication.
- **Dynamic Content**: Movies and categories will be fetched via an API (dummy data used for now).
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile screens.

## Technologies

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **React Router**: For handling routing between pages (Home, Movie Details).
- **TypeScript**: To add static typing for better code quality.
- **Redux**: For global state management, particularly for handling authentication.
- **Redux Toolkit**: To streamline the Redux setup.
- **CSS**: Custom styles to design the layout.
- **Lucide Icons**: For adding icons to buttons and other components.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured, modular architecture:

```bash
src/
├── components/           # Reusable UI components (Header, AuthModal, MovieCategory, etc.)
├── pages/                # Page-level components (Home, MovieDetails)
├── redux/                # Redux slices for managing global state (e.g., auth slice)
├── ui/                   # UI components (Button, Modal)
├── App.tsx               # Main application component
├── index.tsx             # Entry point of the React app
├── App.css               # Global styles
├── utils/store.ts        # Redux store configuration
└── README.md             # Project documentation (this file)
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/movie-streaming-app.git
   cd movie-streaming-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Run the development server**:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn start
   ```

4. **Open the app in the browser**:

   Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:4009) to view the app.

### Available Scripts

- **npm start**: Runs the app in development mode.
- **npm build**: Builds the app for production.
- **npm test**: Launches the test runner.

## API Integration

Currently, the app uses dummy data for movies and categories. In the future, an external movie API (like The Movie Database - TMDb) will be integrated. The following API functionalities will be added:
- Fetch movie categories (Trending, Top Rated)
- Fetch individual movie details
- User authentication (login/signup)
